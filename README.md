# GeneralAutomationFramework

Intended to be:
1) a general automation framework for any type of automation project.
2) linked to a multi-repo for translations, mocks and other resources.

## Decisions:
1) Intentionally not using https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/ due to licencing costs for commercial use until approved
